MY CONTRIBUTIONS (Ruben De La Torre) <br />

As part of Team 10 (Fall 2024, Database Systems @ University of Houston), I contributed the following:
- Built Razor Pages for the **Manager** role to edit shop/store details (name, hours, inventory)
- Developed Razor Pages for the **Zookeeper** role to manage enclosures, animal records, and events
- Wrote and tested **SQL Triggers** to:
  - Automatically mark enclosures as "CLOSED" based on scheduling inputs
  - Prevent zookeepers/employees from assigning themselves more than 2 future events
- Collaborated on queries to generate reports for ticket sales and purchase summaries filtered by date
